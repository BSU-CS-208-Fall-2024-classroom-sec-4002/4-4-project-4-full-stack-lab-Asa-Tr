## Experience

Overall, the experience was just fine. I was able to get everything working with minimal problems. My live preview wouldn't work with this system so I had to just get the localhost through the browser. I decided to have a bit of fun with the extra-credit opportunities in this project too. I did basic sanitization for all of the inputs to any SQL statements and it works fine so it can filter out stuff like comment injection, plain incorrect inputs, etc. I also took the liberty of adding a 'clear list' input so that the whole list can be cleared at once instead of getting arthritis by clearing all the elements individually. Lastly, I also tried to go for the ugliest site extra-credit. That I think went well but it hurts if you look at it for too long. I have it turned off by default because it is so bad, and you can just uncomment the specified lines to get it to work. I do certainly think it meets the definition of ugly though, since I canâ€™t stand to look at it. All I did was reuse all of the assets found in this project and did not bring in anything new.
